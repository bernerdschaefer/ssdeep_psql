Requirements
============

You will need to download ssdeep (tested with 2.1 and 2.5) from http://ssdeep.sourceforge.net/ and then configure and make as usual.

Installation
============

You will want to clone this repository in the contrib folder of your postgres source folder, and then you should be able to run "make" and "make install".

To expose the ssdeep functions in your database, you'll need to issue the following statements:

  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fuzzy_hash(TEXT) RETURNS TEXT AS 'ssdeep_psql.so', 'pg_fuzzy_hash' LANGUAGE 'C';
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION fuzzy_compare(TEXT, TEXT) RETURNS INTEGER AS 'ssdeep_psql.so', 'pg_fuzzy_compare' LANGUAGE 'C';

Usage
=====

  # select fuzzy_hash('john');
   fuzzy_hash 
   ------------
    3:Uvl
    (1 row)
